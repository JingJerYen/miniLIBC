# A small homemade LIBC, LIBC++

## How to build
```make``` : make all targets in build/

## Create to learn
1. How the c/c++ program executed with entry function in libc/libc++
2. How the libc wraps some basic system calls
3. How the global initialization works in c++.
4. A small homemade libc/libc++ supports different platforms such as Linux x86_64, Win32, ...

## Progress
### x86_64 Linux
- [x] entry function
- [ ] system calls wrappers
- [ ] memory operations (malloc, free...)
- [ ] stdio.h
- [ ] string.h
- [ ] global init (.init and .finit in libc++)
- [ ] c++ memory operations (new delete)
- [ ] c++ iostream
- [ ] dynamic library
